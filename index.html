          <p>
            I recently graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a Bachelor in Computer 
            Science. I'm quite interested in programming. I didn't have a clear future plan while I was a senior in high school. 
            At that difficult moment, I discovered the world of coding and software development.
            It was tremendously great to be able to create a working piece of software out of nothing.
            I understood that I could create something significant out of nothing in the world of programming.
            This discovery sparked a desire in me that motivated me to learn more about coding. I quickly realised
            that this subject provided an array of opportunities and pathways, each more fascinating than the last. 
            To get a firm theoretical grounding and investigate the many programming aspects. I chose to go after a degree
            in computer science. I'm really interested in web development and backend coding within this vast field. I'm excited
            about the possibility of developing reliable, effective systems and 
            interesting, user-friendly websites, and I'm ready to acquire and use these talents in my future job.

          <h3>University Education</h3>
          <h4>University of Portsmouth (September 2020 – July 2023)</h4>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>BEng (Hons) Computer Science</li>
            <li>GPA: 2:1</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During my time at the University of Portsmouth, I gained valuable technical skills and hands-on 
            experience that have equipped me for a successful career in computer science:
          </p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>
              Python: I independently developed a program that brought shapes to life through user-defined
              animations, allowing users to customize colors and patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Java: I designed and implemented a front-end system for console output and input,
              coupled with a back-end data management system for smart plugs. To simplify user 
              interaction,I created a console helper object, streamlining complexity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Networks: Collaborating within a team, I contributed to the establishment of a network
              infrastructure for a simulated festival environment. This experience honed my research
              and project management skills, and I assumed the role of group leader, responsible for
              organizing meetings, defining tasks, and tracking project progress.
            </li>
            <li>
              App Creation: For my final year project, I embarked on the independent development of a
              medical diagnosis app using Java. This app features a symptom checker that diagnoses 
              patients based on their responses, a medicine reminder for timely dosages, and various other
              functionalities that facilitate remote medical assistance
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Prior Education</h3>
          <ul class="indent">
            <h4><li>Amman Baptist School (September 2018 – July 2020)</li></h4>
            <li>A-Levels: IT (B), Arabic (B), Math (C)</li>
            <h4><li>Amman Baptist School (September 2018 – July 2018)</li></h4>

          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition to giving me a solid foundation in computer science, my educational experience
            has also established in me a desire for continuous growth and learning.
